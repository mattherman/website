I want to write.

A couple days ago I posted something for the first time since 2020. It felt good. I've always enjoyed writing (editing not so much), but I haven't really had much opportunity since I finished college. I mean, I write every day at my job: emails, documentation, design docs, but those things aren't really for me.

I haven't written because of all the usual excuses. I don't have time. I have nothing to write about. I'm not good enough at it. At the end of the day that's all they are. Excuses.

I've mainly written about programming since it's what I know and is something I enjoy. I'm hoping to continue to do so, but I also want to write about other things in my life like my family, my dogs, gardening, and nature.

If I post something at least once a month I think I will be happy with my progress. Like anything else, the more I do it the easier it will get.
